## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze data on my aram game to get a better understanding how i do overall in my games.

## Objectives

Focus on average stats of each champion played within those aram games and compare those stats to other champions who were played within the dataset.

Note: Other ideas of itemization and curious findings will be utilized in future projects.

## Data Source

Data Retrieved using [Riot Api](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis).

With the assistance of [Chat Gpt](https://chat.openai.com/), python was used to extract data by pulling from the riot api and then put into an excel file.

[Here is the link to the code used.](https://github.com/JLeData/aram_data/blob/main/code/aram_games.py)

## Tools
- Python: Code to extract data
     - Visual Studio 2022 / Visual Code
       
- Excel: Extracted Data
     - [Files here](https://github.com/JLeData/aram_data/tree/main/dataset)
       
- SQL: Data cleaning
     - SQL Server Management Studio 19
     - [Queries here](https://github.com/JLeData/aram_data/blob/main/queries/qrownin_data.md)
       
- Tableau: Create dashboards and visuals
     - Tableau Public Desktop Version

## Results
Dashboard created in Tableau Public Desktop Version and uploaded to Tablea Public

## Limitations

For this personal project, I wanted to get more data as I play a lot of aram games with my friends. This dataset only has 100 of the most recent games I played (at the time) and learning more about how to bypass that limit is something i want to look into further as I continue with new projects. This data was used as practice to learn more about how to retrieve data using other sources rather than the data that is available for public use. This dataset does represent the games i played, but not to the fullest extent of the champions that were not played within those 100 games.

## Personal Goals

I learnt a bunch of new techniques while working on this project. I learnt new ways of obtaining data through Apis which will be very useful tool in the data analyst world. I would love to learn more about coding in general as I only know some basic coding. I believe learning Python and potentially R programming for visuals will be very beneficial for me in the future.

As for SQL, using SQL Server Management Studio 19 was a much better experience. Though there were some issues managing to get the data in the system, overall it was a more straightforward program with all the tools available. I dove into a little more of the complex queries to retrieve the data I needed and also discovered some interesting facts that i would never have found out if i did not do this project. 
(My friend loves not hitting the objective. Yes it is Don and I found that hilarious.) I look forward to keep using SQL as I get better at writing new queries.

I transfered over to the desktop version which actually opened up a lot of options for me to use compared to the browser version. I still found it challenging as Tableau is not very intuitive, but I am getting a better grasp on how to create the fancy dashboards. I do wish sometimes that there were more straightforward options to make something bigger or smaller, but overall I am improving a lot on making these visuals. Once I get even better at Tableau, I hope to create more appealing dashboards with my creative thinking.

Overall, I very much enjoyed working on this project and I am looking even more forward to the next one.
